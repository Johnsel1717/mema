	<h1>What our Students Says</h1>
	<p>Effective testimonials increase your conversion rates. What are the benefits? 
		They build trust by acting as a third-party endorsement, triggering the conformity bias, 
		also known as the bandwagon effect.

		<br>In this way, testimonials are an important form of social proof. Social proof is one of two 
		types of evidence you can include on your website.

						My new site is so much faster and easier to work with than my old site. It used to take me an
